Semester project to obtain my bachelor's degree at EPFL,
and my first experience with Python.

Subject: Coarse-grain modeling of DNA.

The app displays a 3D coarse-grain construction of a 20bp DNA molecule,
using data from a molecular dynamics simulations ("ABC" project),
and allow to transform it by increasing parameters in the direction
of an eigenvector of the stiffness covariance matrix.

It uses Mayavi/mlab for 3D graphics.
